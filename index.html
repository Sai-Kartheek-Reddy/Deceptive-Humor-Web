        Deceptive Humor: Understanding the Humor that Misleads!
      </h1>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Humor is powerful — it brings people together, makes us laugh, and brightens days. But what if some humor hides a darker secret? What if laughter becomes a mask for misinformation that spreads quietly and dangerously? Welcome to the world of Deceptive Humor.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, memes started flooding the internet. One of them read:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="bg-gray-100 border-l-8 border-purple-400 p-6 rounded-lg text-xl italic mb-6">
        “Ch*na products don’t last long — but this virus did. Well played, Ch*na.”
      </blockquote>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        At first glance, it seems like a sarcastic joke. But beneath that humor lies a harmful stereotype and a veiled conspiracy. Such content blends entertainment with dangerous misinformation, leading people to internalize falsehoods — sometimes without even realizing it. That’s the danger of Deceptive Humor.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-6">What Makes Deceptive Humor Different?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
          Deceptive Humor is quite different from traditional humor or the types of humor typically explored in current research. In existing literature, <strong>humor and misinformation are usually treated as two separate domains</strong>. But what if they come together?
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
          That’s what Deceptive Humor is about — when humor is used as a <strong>mask to hide misinformation</strong>. On the surface, it appears as satire or a harmless joke targeting public figures, countries, or communities. But its true intent is to spread bias, false claims, or harmful narratives in a subtle, laughable package.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
          When people are repeatedly exposed to such content — even indirectly — they may start believing it as truth. There have been multiple incidents where such "jokes" have fueled hate, division, and even real-world harm. For instance, during COVID-19, there was a surge in hate toward people associated with Ch*na — all amplified by these seemingly innocent memes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
          <strong>Identifying and mitigating Deceptive Humor is a timely and necessary area of research</strong> — and one that is still underexplored.
