      Deceptive Humor: Understanding the Humor that Misleads!
    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Humor is powerful - it brings people together, makes us laugh, and brightens days. But what if some humor hides a darker secret? What if laughter becomes a mask for misinformation that spreads quietly and dangerously?

      Welcome to the world of Deceptive Humor. 🎭

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-700 mb-6">A Story That Says It All</h2>
    
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      <strong>Picture this:</strong><br />
      It's midnight. You're half-asleep, doom-scrolling through your feed. A meme shows up. It has a cartoon of a bearded man holding a virus-shaped balloon, standing next to a politician in white kurta, both waving from the steps of a plane labeled “Ch*na Express.”
    </p>
    
    <blockquote class="bg-gray-100 border-l-8 border-purple-400 p-6 rounded-lg text-xl italic mb-6">
    “Tabhl*gi Jama*t booked a one-way ticket with Ch*na Airlines, sponsored by Co*gress: Corona Jihad Tour 2020 😷🕌✈️”
    </blockquote>


    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      You burst out laughing. It's outrageous, bizarre, and clearly exaggerated. You forward it to your friends with a “🤣🔥” and call it "meme of the day". Another friend replies with a 🥶 emoji and says, “That’s cold.” Another replies, “Isn’t this pushing a conspiracy?”<br />
      You pause for a moment and start to rethink what you just shared.”
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      But pause for a second.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Beneath the cartoon and the punchline is a very real and dangerous message, a fake claim that a religious group, a political party, and a foreign country have joined forces to spread a deadly virus on purpose. There’s no proof. In fact, it has been debunked by health organizations and experts. But the meme? It doesn’t cite sources. It just makes you laugh... and maybe, just maybe, makes you believe.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      This is how <strong>Deceptive Humor</strong> works: it disguises misinformation as jokes. It spreads without triggering alarm bells, because it never shouts. It whispers. With emojis.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      You didn’t share a conspiracy. You just shared a joke. But that’s exactly how the conspiracy spreads.

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-6">What Makes Deceptive Humor Different?</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Deceptive Humor is quite different from traditional humor or the types of humor typically explored in current research. In existing literature, <strong>humor and misinformation are usually treated as two separate domains</strong>. But what if they come together?
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
    That is what Deceptive Humor is about: when humor is used as a <strong>mask to hide misinformation</strong>. On the surface, it appears as satire or a harmless joke targeting public figures, countries, or communities. However, its true intent is to spread bias, false claims, or harmful narratives in a subtle, laughable package.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
    When people are repeatedly exposed to such content, even indirectly, they may begin to believe it as truth. There have been multiple incidents where such "jokes" have fueled hate, division, and even real-world harm. For instance, during COVID-19, there was a surge in hate toward people associated with Ch*na, all amplified by these seemingly innocent memes.

 <!-- How Deceptive Humor Spreads -->
<section class="bg-white px-10 py-12">
  <div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-700 mb-6">How Deceptive Humor Spreads</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
      At first glance, Deceptive Humor might seem like just another funny meme or sarcastic joke. It makes people laugh, it’s easy to share, and it rarely triggers critical scrutiny. But behind that humor often lies a misleading or harmful claim, subtly embedded within the joke’s punchline.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
      Take the earlier example: “Ch*na products don’t last long, but this virus did. Well played, Ch*na.” On the surface, it's a joke. But if we look closer, it’s implying a dangerous conspiracy, that COVID-19 was intentionally spread by Ch*na as a bioweapon. The humor acts as a shield, making it less likely for people to question the accuracy or intent behind the message.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
      What makes this especially troubling is that <strong>even when people are unaware of the original claim or conspiracy</strong>, repeated exposure to such jokes can plant seeds of belief. Over time, these beliefs can grow, quietly and subconsciously, especially when they are reinforced by similar content across social media.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
      This is how Deceptive Humor spreads: <strong>through humor, repetition, and plausible deniability</strong>. It avoids direct confrontation while nudging people toward biased views or misinformation. That’s why it’s critical to understand, detect, and counter such content before it shapes public opinion in harmful ways.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
    <strong>Identifying and mitigating Deceptive Humor is a timely and necessary area of research</strong>, and one that is still underexplored.
