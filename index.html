        Deceptive Humor: Understanding the Humor that Misleads!

      <p class="text-xl text-purple-800 max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
        Humor is powerful — it brings people together, makes us laugh, and brightens days. But what if some humor hides a darker secret?  
        What if laughter becomes a mask for misinformation that spreads quietly and dangerously?  
        Welcome to the world of <strong>Deceptive Humor</strong>.

      <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Imagine scrolling through your social media feed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among serious news and updates, you spot a meme:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="bg-purple-100 p-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-purple-600 italic text-xl text-purple-900 mb-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
        “Ch*na products usually don’t last long, except this COVID thing.<br>
        Guess Ch*na finally made something that went global and stayed.”
      </blockquote>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        You laugh. It seems clever — a twist on a familiar joke. But underneath the humor lies a harmful conspiracy theory, suggesting COVID-19 is a bioweapon.  
        By sharing, you unknowingly helped spread misinformation masked as humor.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        Deceptive Humor is a form of misinformation disguised as humor. Unlike traditional jokes that aim to entertain without misleading, deceptive humor cleverly embeds false or misleading claims within funny content.  
        This makes it catchy, shareable, and harder to spot as harmful.

        This diagram illustrates how <strong>fake news</strong> is cleverly wrapped in humor, making it more engaging and shareable.  
        Humor lowers our defenses, making misinformation harder to recognize and easier to spread — often without serious scrutiny until the damage is done.
