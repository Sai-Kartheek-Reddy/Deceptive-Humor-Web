      Deceptive Humor: Understanding the Humor that Misleads!
    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Humor is powerful - it brings people together, makes us laugh, and brightens days. But what if some humor hides a darker secret? What if laughter becomes a mask for misinformation that spreads quietly and dangerously?
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-900">
      Welcome to the world of Deceptive Humor. 🎭

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      <strong>Imagine this:</strong><br />
      You're sitting on your couch, late at night, mindlessly scrolling through your phone. You’ve had a rough day, and like most people, you're just looking for something to make you laugh.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Suddenly, a meme pops up in your feed. It's got a cartoon bat holding a suitcase, standing at an airport with a sign that reads:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="bg-gray-100 border-l-8 border-purple-400 p-6 rounded-lg text-xl italic mb-6">
      “Next stop: Global domination. Courtesy of Ch*na Airlines. 🦠✈️”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      You chuckle. It’s absurd. Ridiculous. You even forward it to your group chat with a laughing emoji. One friend replies with a skull emoji. Another says, “Dark… but accurate 😬.”
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      You forget about it by morning.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      <strong>Now rewind that moment.</strong><br />
      What just happened wasn’t just harmless laughter. That meme carried a subtle, conspiratorial message, suggesting that COVID-19 was part of a deliberate plan by Ch*na. The humor made it easier to digest. Easier to share. And most dangerously… easier to believe.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      No aggressive headline. No serious tone. Just a joke. But the impact? Real.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      This is <strong>Deceptive Humor</strong>: misinformation wrapped in a punchline. You didn’t mean to spread a conspiracy. You just wanted a laugh. But that’s exactly how it works.

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-6">What Makes Deceptive Humor Different?</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Deceptive Humor is quite different from traditional humor or the types of humor typically explored in current research. In existing literature, <strong>humor and misinformation are usually treated as two separate domains</strong>. But what if they come together?
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
    That is what Deceptive Humor is about: when humor is used as a <strong>mask to hide misinformation</strong>. On the surface, it appears as satire or a harmless joke targeting public figures, countries, or communities. However, its true intent is to spread bias, false claims, or harmful narratives in a subtle, laughable package.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
    When people are repeatedly exposed to such content, even indirectly, they may begin to believe it as truth. There have been multiple incidents where such "jokes" have fueled hate, division, and even real-world harm. For instance, during COVID-19, there was a surge in hate toward people associated with Ch*na, all amplified by these seemingly innocent memes.

 <!-- How Deceptive Humor Spreads -->
<section class="bg-white px-10 py-12">
  <div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-700 mb-6">How Deceptive Humor Spreads</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
      At first glance, Deceptive Humor might seem like just another funny meme or sarcastic joke. It makes people laugh, it’s easy to share, and it rarely triggers critical scrutiny. But behind that humor often lies a misleading or harmful claim, subtly embedded within the joke’s punchline.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
      Take the earlier example: “Ch*na products don’t last long, but this virus did. Well played, Ch*na.” On the surface, it's a joke. But if we look closer, it’s implying a dangerous conspiracy, that COVID-19 was intentionally spread by Ch*na as a bioweapon. The humor acts as a shield, making it less likely for people to question the accuracy or intent behind the message.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
      What makes this especially troubling is that <strong>even when people are unaware of the original claim or conspiracy</strong>, repeated exposure to such jokes can plant seeds of belief. Over time, these beliefs can grow, quietly and subconsciously, especially when they are reinforced by similar content across social media.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
      This is how Deceptive Humor spreads: <strong>through humor, repetition, and plausible deniability</strong>. It avoids direct confrontation while nudging people toward biased views or misinformation. That’s why it’s critical to understand, detect, and counter such content before it shapes public opinion in harmful ways.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">
    <strong>Identifying and mitigating Deceptive Humor is a timely and necessary area of research</strong>, and one that is still underexplored.
