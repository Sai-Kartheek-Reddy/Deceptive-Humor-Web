        Deceptive Humor: Understanding the Humor that Misleads!
      </h1>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
        Humor is powerful — it brings people together, makes us laugh, and brightens days. But what if some humor hides a darker secret? What if laughter becomes a mask for misinformation that spreads quietly and dangerously? Welcome to the world of Deceptive Humor.

      <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl">
        Imagine scrolling through your social media feed during the COVID-19 pandemic. You come across a meme:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg border-l-8 border-purple-400 italic text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-4xl">
        "Ch*na products don’t last long… but this virus sure did!"
      </blockquote>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl">
        You laugh. Maybe you share it with friends. But what if beneath that joke, a dangerous conspiracy is being spread — suggesting COVID-19 was a bioweapon? Without realizing it, you might have helped that falsehood go viral.

            Deceptive Humor is misinformation cleverly wrapped inside humor. Unlike traditional jokes that aim to entertain harmlessly, deceptive humor uses wit to spread false claims without raising suspicion.

                    A joke based on a false claim that COVID-19 was spread intentionally — mixing humor with misinformation to mislead.
