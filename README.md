## Examples of Humorous Comments

Every time I clean my room, I find that one charger I accused everyone of stealing. 🙈😎

I downloaded a fitness app. Now it just sends motivational insults. 😤

I asked Google how to be productive 😌. It showed me 47 articles, which I read instead of working. 🤦‍♂️

I tried cooking last night for the first time 🥶😂. The fire department said it was deliciously dangerous. 🔥🚒🧯

I asked my mirror who's the laziest of them all. It sighed and said, "You again?" 😒

Exercise? I thought you said extra fries. 🤤

**Enjoyed the humorous comments?**  
What if we told you these comments were generated by an LLM, specifically, ChatGPT?  
Yes, AI can be funny too! 😄

Yes, AI can make people laugh and effectively generate humorous content, often just as effectively as humans. This can be great for relaxing, entertainment, and creativity.

But what if it misguides us?

That’s exactly what we explored in this project, **Deceptive Humor**, where humor has the power to mislead and manipulate.
